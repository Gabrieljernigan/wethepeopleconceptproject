                                    to 1950, Henry Hay founded the Mattachine Foundation, one of the nation's first gay rights groups. The organization coined the term, "homophile," which was focused on sexual activity than "homosexual." The organization
                                    grew quickly, improving the lives of gay men through activities and groups. The Mattachine Society inspired four lesbian couples to found the "Daughters of Bilitis," which created <em>The Ladder</em>, the first lesbian
                                    publication. After this, the movement faced the mental disorder setback deemed by the American Psychiatric Association in 1952. In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed an executive order that banned people guilty
                                    of "sexual perversion," or gay people, from federal jobs, which lasted around twenty years. (Gay Rights - Movement, Marriage &amp; Flag - HISTORY)</p>

                                <p class="mb-5">In the 1960s, the gay rights movement had some progress: &nbsp;in 1961, Illinois was the first state to unban anti-sodomy laws which incriminated homosexuality, and a Californian T.V. station made a documentary about homosexuality,
                                    called "The Rejected." In 1965, Dr. John Oliven coined the term "transgender," deeming a person born in the wrong sex, and in &gt;10 years later, the first man went under sex-reassignment surgery in Denmark. Even with
                                    such success, LGBT people were harassed and persecuted in public areas, such as prohibiting the distrobution of alcohol due to liquor laws that deemed homosexuals to be disorderly. To prevent being shut down, bartenders
                                    denied selling drinks to people thought of as gay, or kick them out. In 1966 in retort to these instances, members of the Mattachine Society of New York city staged a "sip-in," which was a changed "sit-in" protest in
                                    the 1960s, where they visited taverns, dictated that they were gay, and waited to be prohibited service in order to sue, which ended up revoking the anti-gay liquor laws. The new name for the movement was "The Stonewall
                                    Riots," after a clandestine gay club, named the Stonewall Inn, allowed dancing, drag queens, and homeless youths. However, on June 29, 1969, New York City police raided the Inn, whereas, as a retort, patrons &amp; local
                                    residents threw objects at the police officers, which quickly escalated into a riot, which lasted for five more days. (Gay Rights - Movement, Marriage &amp; Flag - HISTORY)</p>

                                <p class="mb-5">After the Stonewall Riot, members of the Mattachine Society left the society in order to create the Gay Liberation Front, which was a radical group that created public demonstrations, protests, and political confrontations;
                                    following the Mattachine Society, more groups formed, such as the Gay Activists Alliance, Radicalesbians, and more. In 1970, one year after the Riots, New York City residents launched an event called the Christopher
                                    Street Liberation Day, also known as the country's first gay pride parade. The Pink Triangle is now a symbol of gay pride.<br>Due to the new visibility/activism of the LGBT community in the 1970s, the movement had progressed,
                                    such as how Harvey Milk, who was the first openly gay man elected into a political office, campaigned on a gay rights platform. The gay pride flag wasn't enough as a pink triangle, so Milk asked a gay rights activist,
                                    Gilbert Baker, to create a symbol of pride, which is now known as a rainbow- this was shown at a pride parade in 1978. Following this parade, in 1979, well over 100,000 people marched on the first National March on
                                    Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. (Gay Rights - Movement, Marriage &amp; Flag - HISTORY)</p>

                                <p class="mb-5">Because homophobia, or the hatred/disliking of homosexuality, is so prominent, anything that is a result of homosexuality, is strictly homosexuality's fault. The global HIV virus has been linked the LGBT's sodomy, which
                                    quickly led to an alert of a "gay plague," which led to a demeaning fall to the LGBT community. This "plague" led to violence, discrimination, ban of same-sex relationships, cross-dressing, sodomy, and gender impersonation,
                                    as well as various forms of human right violations. Because of all this hatred, a self-stigma, called "internalised homophobia," sprung into action which increased the homophobia, strengthening the idea that any LGBT
                                    community member can and will have AIDS &amp;/or HIV. (Homophobia and HIV | Avert)<br>In addition to the "gay plague" incident, the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," or DADT act, was coined after Bill Clinton, president in 1993,
                                    signed a law that prevented "asking, telling, pursuing, and harassing" homosexuals. The policy was meant to lift the ban on homosexuality in the workforce that was instituted during WWII, but led to much more hatred,
                                    preventing homosexual servicemen and servicewomen from serving the country's military. This was simply due to the ideology that fearing the presence of gays in the armed forces would shatter morale and further subverted
                                    the policy by suits of discrimination that upheld the right of gays to server in the military. In essence, that DADT prohibited homosexuals serving in the military from taking about their sexual orientation or engage
                                    in sexual activity; furthermore, commanding officers were not allowed to question sexuality. This was a poor attempt to "allow" gays to serve in the military, which led to many gay rights activists criticizing the policy
                                    for forcing gays into secrecy, leading gays and lesbians to be discharged from service. This policy was repealed by President Barack Obama. (Don't Ask, Don't Tell | United States policy | Britannica.com)</p>

                                <p class="mb-5">In 1993, the highest court of Hawaii ruled that a ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional; state voters disagreed, leading to the 1998 law banning same-sex marriage. Federal alwmakers also disagreed, and Congress passed
                                    the Defence of Marriage Act (DOMA), which Bill Clinton signed into law in 1996. The law prevented the federal government from providing benefits to same-sex couples, and allowed states to not permit same-sex marriage
                                    certificates from external states; though, gay rights advocates recieved other victories. In 1994, a new anti-hate-crime law allowed judged to strengthen sentences if a crime is motivated by sexual orientation. (Gay

                                <p class="mb-5">In 2003, gay right followers were surprised by a U.S. Supreme Court, in Lawrence vs. Texas, removing Texas's anti-sodomy law, which decriminalized homosexual relations throughout the United States; followed by this, in
                                    2009, Obama enacted the Matthew Shepard Act, which extended the ideology and meaning of the 1994 hate crime law. The Matthew Shepard Act was a response to the 1998 murder of Mathew Shepard, whom was pistol-whipped,
                                    tortured, bound, and left to die. The murder was driven by Shepard's perceived homosexuality. In 2011, Obama finished a campaign promise to redact Don't Ask, Don't Tell, whereas well over 12,000 officers in the United
                                    States military had been discharged from service for refusing to hide their sexuality. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled against section 3 of DOMA, which let it become powerless; in 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that
                                    states can't ban same-sex marriage, making gay marriage legal country-wide. After the 2015 ruling, the Boy Scoutys of America revoked its ban against openly gay leaders and employees, and, in 2017, reversed a ban against
                                    transgender boys, alike to the Girl Scouts of the United States, which allowed the first transgender Girl Scout in 2011. In 2016, the U.S. military allowed transgender people to serve openly, a month after Eric Fanning
                                    became secretary of the Army, and first openly gay secretary of a United States military branch. In the March of 2018, President Donald J. Trump banned most transgender people from military service.

                                    In 2015, there was a Supreme Court case, called <i>Overgefell v Hodges</i>, that made banning same-sex marriages in any state illegal. Groups in the country sued their state for prohibiting their marriage, which went to the Supreme Court.
                                    The 5-4 decision in favour of marriage equality stated that, under the Fourteeth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, the states must provide a marriage license to same-sex couples, as well as recognize external marriage licenses.

                                    Americans can now have same-sex marriage, their work for universal workplace anti-discrimination laws for LGBT Americans is yet to be concluded. Gay rights proponents must substitute for "religious liberty" state laws,
                                    preventing LGBT service for religious beliefs, and anti-transgender bathroom laws. (Gay Rights - Movement, Marriage &amp; Flag - HISTORY)</p>
